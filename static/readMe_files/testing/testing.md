# Testing


### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar (or sidenav for screens smaller than 991px) to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a collapsible that is framed with a shade of green to immediately catch the attention of the user. Clicking on the collapsible will expand an area where the user can find some basic instructions about the porpose and how to use the application.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the framed collapsible.
        3. The user has two options, scroll down and click the link underneath the form or click the link in the navigation bar, both will lead to the same place, to create an account and be able to access the application.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the application to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. When the visitor is logged in, clicking the logo is always directing the user to the collection/home page.    
        
        
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to add new films.
        1. Once the visitor access the site with a new profile, the user can easily find the link "Add Film" in the navigation bar and start to compose his collection.
        2. On the "Add Film" Page, after the form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to his collection/home page and a flash message on the top of the page is displayed and saying: "Film Successfully Added".
        

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to have easy and fast access to the film's informations.

        1. Once the visitor is logged in, he only need to click on a collapsible-header that contain a film and the expandable area will display the hidden informations of that  film.
        
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to easily be able to filter one or more specific film that I'm looking for.

        1. Once the visitor is logged in, on the top of the collection page the user can find the search bar as first content available.
        2. The search bar is the perfect tool to filter the user research. The research could be based on the film title, or only one word contained in it.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to easily be able to update or cancel an exsisting record.
        1. In the collection page, every film is displayed with 2 buttons: edit and delete. 
        2. The edit button direct the user to the "Edit Film" page. Here the user has the opportunity to update the informations contained in the record.
        3. After the form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to his collection/home page and a flash message on the top of the page is displayed and saying: "Film Successfully Updated".
        4. The delete button gives the user the opportunity to delete a film. When the user click on the button, a message appears on the screen saying:"Are you sure to delete this film?"
        If the user click "Yes", a flash message on the top of the page is displayed and saying: "Film Successfully Deleted". 

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added function or content.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new options to manipulate the record information.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily navigate through it.
