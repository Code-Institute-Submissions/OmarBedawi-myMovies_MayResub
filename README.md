### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and choose [myMovies](https://github.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies).
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](http://my-first-heroku-for-movies.herokuapp.com/login) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and choose [myMovies](https://github.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies).
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and choose [myMovies](https://github.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies).
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies

## Goals
### Tiffany's Films Archive goals

The goal of this website is to easily display the collection and facilitate the user to add, edit and delete films from the collection in the home page.

### Target audience is:

* Tiffany: a films collector who is looking for an application to storage and have fast and easy access to her films informations.


### Business goals

* Interactive web-app
* Fully functional web app
* Intuitive design
* Easy to navigate


### Customer goals

* Find easy to access the collection and localize the desired films: typing in the search bar the film title or only one word of it. 
* Find easy to add a new film to the collection and eventually modify its information or delete it from the collection.


## Installation

In the head of the project I have installed the links to have access to different libraries. 

In the picture, the links are wrapped in red.

1. Font Awesome: is an icon library. 
1. Materialize: a library with templates for buttons, forms, sidenav and so many other components. For this project for example I used it to build the navigation bar, 
the search bar and the buttons.
1. The last link below is showing where the style.css file is located.

This project has been built using jinja template engine. 
Jinja allows you to write an html code and be able to reproduce that code in all the other html page where you want to use it again.
Jinja is very useful for header, navbar and footers because you don't need to code them again.
The jinja parenthesis are wrapped in blue lines in the picture below.

![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies/master/static/readMe_files/screenshots/1_header.png?raw=true)
  
  
* Scripts and JavaScript files are located at the end of the page to be loaded for last.

## User Stories

I built this website using the Materialize library.
All the componenets I used like the top NavBar, the side Bar, forms, buttons, collapsibles come from this library, that is very helpful to provide you very responsive components.

The homepage is where the list of films are located, because the user wish to have a direct access to the collection when she starts the application.

Above the collection there is a search bar to find the desire film among a list of more than 500 films.

Every film is stored and displayed in a collapsible that shows only the film title, but when you click on it, the collapsible expands his area and shows the informations
that the user needs.

The buttons "delete" and "edit" next to the film title are available only for the users who have added that specific film.

In case of films added by other users the "delete" and "edit" buttons are not displayed.

In the expandable area you can find informations as the genre of the film, the year, the ID of the user, a Wikipedia link and the username of who has added the film.

foto collezione
foto tiff id


The "add film" page is composed by a form with 5 labels to fill with the information desired by the user: 

* the title
* the genre
* the year
* the Tiffany ID
* a Wikipedia link

The user (Tiffany) has numbered every movie and attached a label on it.
That number is what is called Tiffany ID in the expandable area.

![Tiffany ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies/master/static/readMe_files/screenshots/tiff_films3.jpg?raw=true)


The "edit film" page is identical to the "add film" page but you edit informations instead to add it.

![add page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies/master/static/readMe_files/screenshots/add_film.png?raw=true)
![edit page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/myMovies/master/static/readMe_files/screenshots/edit_film.png?raw=true)



The "register" page allows you to create your username and password.

The "log in" page allows you to access (with your username and password) the functions of the app.

If you are not logged in, you can only view the list of films and open the expandable area in the homepage.
When you are logged in you can add films to the collection and they will be labeled as films added by you.
You can edit or delete only the films added by your username.


The "profile" page is telling you which profile is logged in.

All the films and the relative informations in the homepage are stored in a database called Mongo DB, and thanks to Flask and Python I have been able to import and connect
them all to my Github repository and create the desired functions inside the app.py file.

The CSS file is divided by comments, that I used as title to separate the html pages or the screen size sections. 
This make any future correction or class/id research much easier.
